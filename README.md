# Apple Fitness Final Project

This project takes an in-depth look into the various factors that played a role in my physical health during the 2022 Spring Semester. Through the use of Apple Watch's fitness technology, I was able to collect a variety of different attributes that kept daily logs about my physical health. This included calories burned, daily exercise durations, average heart rates, and much more. Additionally, the goal of the project was to see how external factors influenced my daily activity and routines such as the weather and days of the week. In order to get this data MeteoStat's Weather API was used to provide detailed logs of daily temperatures and precipitation levels for each day in Spokane.

The project performed an extensive exploratory data analysis with the datasets, and it followed the following general outline:

1. **Introduction**: dataset explanation and loading into dataframes
2. **Data Analysis**: data cleaning, visualizations, and hypothesis testing
3. **Classification**: kNN and Decision Tree classifiers
4. **Conclusion**: closing remarks and ethical applications

This exploratory data analysis just scratches the surface of the possibilities that could explain how my physical health changes over the course of a school year. My hope is that a continuation of my own data collection as well as an analysis of other college students' activity data could help to paint a better picture of some of the relationships analyzed in my project.

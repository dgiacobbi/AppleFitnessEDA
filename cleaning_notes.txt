Daily Health Data Cleaning To-Do:
    - delete Heart Rate column (don't know what it measures)
    - fill all other Heart Rates with average or interpolation??
    - fill flights climbed with 0, no log for no calculable stories
    - delete stand hours (no data)

Workouts Health Data Cleaning To-Do:
    - delete Elevation descended (no data)
    - delete Elevation ascended (not enough data)
    - delete Flights climbed
    - delete swim stroke cadence
    - delete swimming stroke count
    - delete distance
    - delete step count
    - delete active energy (same as total energy for a workout)

Potential Data Visualization Graphs (at least 5 graphs, 3 usable for analysis):
    - avg temperature v. date line plot
    - prec. totals v. date line plot
    - active calories v. date line plot (same graph)

    - bar graph: days of the week v. average exercise duration
    - bar graph: days of the week v. avg heart Rate
    - bar graph: days of the week v. active kcal

    - scatter plot with temp averages and exercise durations

Hypothesis Tests (2-3 minimum):
    - are active calories greater during the week than the weekend?
    - is excercise duration greater when it is warmer or colder?
    - are strength training workouts higher intensity than other workouts?
